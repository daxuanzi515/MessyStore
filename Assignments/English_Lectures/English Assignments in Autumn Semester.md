# English Assignments in Autumn Semester

## Week1

### section1

For many people, the fear of speaking in public is greater than the fear of death.

This anxiety originates from our innate social instincts and the desire for a good reputation. However, this fear can be converted into a tool for effective speech preparation. TED speakers, like Monica Lewinsky have used their nervous energy to create impactful presentations. A successful speech can dramatically change outcomes, inspire audiences, open doors, and even save organizations. 

Elon Musk demonstrated this by motivating his team after a rocket launch failure, while Amy Cuddy showed how body language can enhance confidence. These examples show that with the right approach, public speaking can lead to personal and professional growth.

What's more, the writer also gave himself examples for me to express that a good speech is so significant for him and he could do better to change the past condition. At the ending of this passage, he encourages readers to be braver and learn to present themselves by speaking.

## Week2

### section1

Most people get anxious about speaking in public, but actually, they don't know that their real problem is that they often fail to deliver a meaningful speech in one try. 

Bruno Giussani from TED points out that speakers need a reliable plan, not just for individual points, but for the talk's overall structure. The missing piece is often a "throughline," a central theme that connects every part of the speech. This topic should be convincing and go through the entire presentation like a thread to ensure that each part includes to a single, major idea instead of cluttered ideas.

To complete a pretty good talk, it is important for us to focus on developing this throughline, making it attracted and unexpected. Practice describing your speech's core information in just a few words or with a short sentence. That's what will leave your audience with a deep impression.

### section2

An unplanned speech sometimes is a punchline in your whole presentation. But if you perform terrible like being all of a quiver or turning red with embarrassment and say something incoherently, it will be the scariest part in your show. What's more, your audiences may not be so kind to you for you miserable speech. They may be suspicious and disappointed with your performance, even laugh or boo to you. That makes you more nervous and easy to make mistakes. As a worst result, you may fail to complete your speech with sadness and awkwardness, and leave the scene eventually. 

Therefore, it is important for a great speaker to prepare enough for his knowledge reserve and practise as much as possible. In that way, he can naturally produce some magical unplanned speeches during many performances instead of messing up everything. During the practice process, don't be afraid of dropping the ball frequently. This is the path every successful speaker must take.

### section3

To effectively communicate ideas, a speaker must build a human connection with the audience. This involves overcoming natural `defenses` like `skepticism` and mistrust by showing vulnerability and authenticity. Luckily, making eye contact and smiling can help us build trust, such as sharing personal stories and showing humility. With these `behaviors`, you can quickly create a solid bend with others.

Humor, when used appropriately, can also create a bond and make the audience more receptive to the message. It's crucial to avoid egocentricity and focus on the audience's experience. 

Storytelling is a powerful tool for creating interest and empathy, but it must be genuine to avoid alienating the audience. 

Political or divisive topics can hinder connection, so speakers should aim to find common ground and shared humanity. Ultimately, the goal is to make the audience feel that they are on a journey with the speaker, leading to a more impactful and memorable talk.

### section2

Sophie Scott's TED talk introduces a new view of laughter. Public speaking bases on valuable ideas, not just charisma. It's vital to connect with the audience and use language effectively. Words matter more than assumed in communication. A speech should be a guided journey for the audience.

## Week6

### section1

1 & 2:

In the Mehrabian's 7-38-55 Communication Model, he has concluded that only 7% of feelings and attitudes takes place through the words we use in spoken communications, while 38% takes place through tone and voice and the remaining 55% take place through body language.

So the first statement is True, because 7% in words is correct.

But the second one is False, 59% in body language is wrong.

3.PPPPPP means that Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Poor Performance instead of Promote Poor Performance. 6 P's can help remind you that more preparation yields better results. So the third one is False.

4.Delivery' refers to the way in which you actually deliver or perform or give your presentation. It not just only represents "Delivery only refers the presentation you give your audience." The forth statement is False too.

1.T 2.F 3.F 4.F

### section2

1.From my perspectives, the point of an introduction is to attract your audiences' attention, throw some interesting questions and demonstrate your core theme.

2.The point of a conclusion is to summarize your ideas mentioned, reemphasize your keywords and make a proper end for your presentation. It should be short and general compared with an introduction.

### section3

1. **Storytelling's Role in Human Evolution**: Stories have been integral to human development, with evidence suggesting that they coevolved with the human mind. Around a million years ago, the control of fire brought people together, leading to social bonding and storytelling as a prevalent form of interaction.
2. **Social and Cognitive Benefits**: Anthropologist Polly Wiessner's research indicates that storytelling was crucial for expanding imagination, understanding others' minds, and building social networks. It also provided social status and insights, likely influencing the evolution of modern humans.
3. **Elements of a Great Story**: A classic story formula involves a protagonist with goals who encounters obstacles, leading to a climax and resolution. Effective storytelling for an audience involves empathy, tension, appropriate detail, and a satisfying ending.
4. **Storytelling in Public Speaking**: Stories are powerful in speeches because they are relatable and easy to follow. They can evoke strong responses and create empathy. However, the story must be true, well-edited, and offer insights or value to the audience, not just be self-indulgent.
5. **The Power of Parables**: Parables, as a form of storytelling, can carry moral or metaphorical lessons. They can be effective in explaining complex ideas by making them relatable, but they require careful crafting to ensure the analogy fits and the message is clear.
6. **Storytelling for Explanation**: Stories can also serve to explain or reinforce an idea, often as part of a larger narrative. They help in making complex concepts more accessible and engaging.
7. **Importance of Authenticity and Impact**: Authentic, truthful stories that are meant to benefit the audience can be a powerful gift. They should be told with humility, honesty, and vulnerability to resonate deeply with listeners.
8. **Conclusion**: Stories are a fundamental part of human nature, and using them in communication can significantly enhance connection and understanding. They must be crafted to provide meaning and value to the audience.

----

1. **Building Understanding Through Explanation**: Dan Gilbert's TED Talk exemplifies how to explain a complex idea like "synthesized happiness" by starting with the audience's current knowledge, sparking curiosity, introducing concepts progressively, using metaphors, and providing examples.

2. **The Importance of Metaphors and Examples**: Metaphors such as the flight simulator and the psychological immune system help make abstract concepts more relatable. Examples, like the experience of paraplegics and lottery winners, make the implications of these concepts more tangible.

3. **The Curse of Knowledge**: This cognitive bias makes experts assume that their audience understands jargon or has the same foundational knowledge. To overcome this, get feedback on drafts from those unfamiliar with the topic and practice explaining concepts to lay audiences.

4. **Creating Excitement Through Explanation**: By clearly explaining complex ideas, speakers can generate excitement and inspire audiences. Bonnie Bassler's TED Talk on bacteria communication is a case in point, where she made the subject relevant, used engaging narratives, and built her explanation without resorting to jargon.

5. **Stepwise Explanation**: Effective explanations are constructed step by step, ensuring that each part builds upon the previous one. This method helps audiences follow the logic and integrate new information into their existing knowledge.

6. **Relevance and Reduction of Jargon**: Make the topic relevant to the audience and avoid unnecessary jargon. Explaining complex ideas in accessible language allows audiences to engage with the material and feel a sense of discovery.

7. **Structural Clarity**: Use phrases that indicate the structure of the talk, such as "Let's build on that..." or "On the other hand...". This helps audiences navigate the talk's trajectory and understand how different points connect.

8. **Feedback and Revision**: Seek feedback on your explanations to identify and fill in knowledge gaps. Revisions based on this feedback are crucial for ensuring that your talk is understandable and impactful.

3.tell a story

Let us journey back to December 28, 1895, at the Grand Café in Paris, where the Lumière brothers premiered the cinematography. This first public projection was not just a technological marvel, it was the inception of cinematic storytelling.

   - **Informative Speech:** The primary goal is to educate, inform, or increase the audience's understanding of a particular topic.
   - **Persuasive Speech:** The aim is to convince the audience to adopt a specific belief, take a particular action, or change their behavior.
2. **Content Focus:**
   - **Informative Speech:** Focuses on providing facts, data, and objective information without advocating for a particular viewpoint.

### section3

1. **The Power of Reason in Persuasion**: Reason is a potent tool for persuasion because it can provide a high level of certainty. If an argument is structured logically, with each step building upon true premises, the conclusions can be seen as necessarily true.
2. **Priming the Audience**: Before presenting a reasoned argument, it's important to prepare the audience by challenging their existing beliefs or assumptions, often through storytelling, humor, or vivid examples. This process, known as priming, makes them more receptive to the new ideas that follow.
3. **The Structure of a Persuasive Argument**: A persuasive talk often involves a detective-story structure, where the speaker guides the audience through a process of elimination to arrive at the most plausible conclusion. This method engages the audience and makes them active participants in the argument.
4. **Enhancing Reason with Other Tools**: While reason is crucial, it can be supplemented with other tools such as humor, personal anecdotes, vivid examples, third-party validation, and powerful visual AIDS to enhance persuasion and make conclusions not only valid, but also meaningful, exciting, and desirable.
5. **The Long-term Impact of Reason**: Reasoned arguments may not always gain immediate acceptance, but they have the potential to gradually persuade and accumulate supporters over time, leading to significant and lasting change.
6. **The Role of Intuition Pumps**: Intuition pumps, such as metaphors or thought experiments, are used to nudge the audience towards a certain conclusion. They make the argument seem more plausible without necessarily providing rigorous proof.
7. **The Importance of Emotional Engagement**: To ensure that the audience retains the argument, it's important to engage them emotionally. This can be achieved through humor, personal stories, or dramatic examples that make the talk memorable and impactful.
8. **The Gradual Nature of Persuasion**: Persuasion is often a slow process, akin to the growth of an oak tree. Reasoned arguments may take time to be accepted, but once they are, they can lead to profound and enduring shifts in worldview.

## Week9

### section1

The speaker who uses powerful examples is a qualified speaker. In my opinion, a perfect speech cannot lack powerful examples to provide credible proofs for proving your central argument. These examples make the speech credible and reliable, demonstrate a clear picture for their audiences.

These examples can simplify their complex contents or concepts, making them digestible and memorable. For example, it is so hard for us to explain a word without any prior knowledge, like "Valentine's Day". If you don't know western culture and myths, you may not understand what it represents for? But you can use your detailed examples to demonstrate it to your audiences, "it is a holiday for celebrating love and affection. Couples often give cards, chocolates, and flowers, especially red roses, to express their feelings. Some also plan special dates or parties to mark the occasion." It is easy for us to show an unknown thing by this way.

4. **Potential for Digression**: Without a visual structure, speeches can sometimes go off on tangents.
5. **Less Visual Engagement**: Speeches may lack the visual engagement that can help retain audience attention.

**Pros of a Presentation:**

1. **Visual Aids**: Presentations often include slides, graphics, and other visual aids that can enhance understanding and retention.
2. **Interactive**: Presentations usually involve more audience interaction through Q&A sessions or interactive activities.
3. **Structured Format**: The use of slides and other aids provides a clear structure for the content.

### section3

1. **Clarity and Structure**:

- The table in the first graph divides sleep information for newborns based on their age. It allows for an easy comparison among age groups (1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks, etc.).
- It is well-structured, with total sleep, night sleep, and day sleep clearly delineated. For example, it is easy to know that as the baby grows older, their total sleep time decreases (from 18 hours at 1-2 weeks to 15.5 hours at 2-3 months), while night sleep remains constant at 12 hours.

2. **direct Information**:

- The table gives a direct and clear understanding of what is expected for each age group. 
- For example, at 6-8 weeks, babies should sleep 16 hours, with 12 hours at night and 4 hours during the day. This can be useful for parents who are trying to establish a sleep schedule for their newborns.

Comparison to the Second Graph:

- The second graph is more complex and less immediately useful. The scattered data points might be harder to interpret for a parent looking for straightforward information.



## Week13

### section1

After this week's lesson, I would most likely use a pie chart because it effectively illustrates the proportions of a whole that has been divided into different segments. Pie charts are ideal for showing how each category contributes to the total, which is particularly useful when the focus is on the relationship of parts to a whole.

For instance, if the lesson was about the distribution of budget allocations across different departments in a company, a pie chart would clearly demonstrate the percentage each department receives from the total budget. This visual representation would make it easy for viewers to grasp the relative size of each department's share at a glance.

Moreover, pie charts are simple to understand and can be quickly interpreted, making them a popular choice for presentations and reports where clarity and brevity are essential. They are also versatile and can be customized with colors and labels to enhance the visual appeal and provide additional information about each segment.

Without computers and PPTs, it means that it can be a type of dynamic deduction speech.

To use some objects and gestures to deduct specific scenarios.

Items that I would use and how I would use:

1. **Visual Aids**: Use items like maps, flags, or other visual symbols to represent different concepts or locations.
2. **Storyboards**: Create a series of images or illustrations on cards that you can sequence to tell a story or explain a process step by step.
3. **Flip Chart or Whiteboard**: Use a flip chart or whiteboard to draw diagrams, flowcharts, or write key points as you speak. This allows you to visually represent your ideas in real-time.
4. **Audio Recordings**: If your presentation includes examples of sounds or music, consider using a tape recorder or CD player to play these audio clips.

If you don't try, you won't succeed.

I had to mention my unforgotten experience in 2023, one try of `BaoYan`, a way that enter university for graduate without extra examination.

Due to some reasons, I didn't engage in some summer extra interviews before my try. And the in September, it was the last chance for me to enter university for continuous learning. However, no friends together, no parents' helps, no seniors' guidance, I was alone and went to target universities with little afraid. I tried to calm down, review my knowledge and prepare my brief English introduction during taking plane and high-speed rail.

I faced with some strict teachers and some kind professors in different universities' interviews. Finally, I chose `ShanghaiTech` University as my destination of my `BaoYan`  after a deep consideration. I hadn't thought about my final result before, when I didn't have the courage to do anything to change my future. So I think that trying to something is better than doing nothing, just in case it works.

informative:

It can carry and expand more information to others. 

persuasive:

It can persuade more audiences in one speaking instead of repeating information and using complex indicated skills.

extemporaneous:

It can make audiences more immersive in your speech.

reasons:

I think I will use informative speaking during I had to teach knowledge in classes, because it can deliver more information to audiences than other ways.

Persuasive speaking is suitable for a big public speech in some important  sites like conference hall. You need to persuade a large number of people in a speech.

From my prospective, extemporaneous speaking can be used to a scenario that you need to interact with audiences frequently and make some surprises.

### section2

In this semester's English class, I’ve learned two important things: **expressing myself courageously** and **combining independent thinking with teamwork**.

First, through class discussions and presentations, I became more confident in expressing my opinions. By practicing my language and thinking skills, I learned to clearly communicate my ideas and listen to others. This not only improved my speaking skills but also helped me respect different viewpoints.

Second, I improved my ability to think independently while working in a team. Group projects and discussions taught me how to cooperate with others and make the most of everyone’s strengths. At the same time, I learned the value of sharing my own ideas and helping the group move forward. This made me more effective in both teamwork and problem-solving.

These skills have not only made my learning experience better but also prepared me to communicate and collaborate with others confidently in the future.

### section3

Pros:

1. **Emotional Support**: High school relationships can provide emotional support during a challenging time of personal growth.
2. **Learning Experience**: They offer opportunities to learn about communication, compromise, and empathy.
3. **Social Skills Development**: Relationships can help students develop interpersonal skills that are important for future interactions.

Cons:

1. **Distraction from Studies**: High school relationships can sometimes distract students from academic goals.
2. **Emotional Stress**: Breakups or conflicts in relationships can lead to significant emotional stress, affecting well-being.
3. **Peer Pressure**: There can be social pressure to be in a relationship, which may lead students to make choices they are not ready for.

## Week15

### section1

I **disagree** with the statement that "social networking sites are used for stalking instead of communicating." Here are four strong points to support my argument:

1. **Primary Purpose is Communication**:

Social networking platforms are designed primarily for communication. They enable people to stay connected, share updates, and engage in meaningful conversations with family, friends, and colleagues, regardless of geographical distance.

2. **Encouraging Positive Interactions**:

Most social media sites have features that promote communication, such as direct messaging, group chats, and video calls. These tools facilitate positive and open interactions, which are used far more often than stalking activities.

3. **Privacy and Safety Measures**:

Social networking platforms offer privacy settings that allow users to control who can view their profiles, posts, and contact them. These measures are specifically designed to reduce unwanted attention and protect users from being stalked.

4. **Misuse is an Exception, Not the Norm**:

While it is true that some people misuse social networking sites for stalking, this is a small minority. The vast majority of users engage in normal, healthy communication, and the platforms actively combat misuse through reporting features and user moderation.
