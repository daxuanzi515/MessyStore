Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Program Analysis and Code Quality Enhancement:

Explore how LLMs can assist or automate various tasks in program analysis. 

Focus on:

perform static and dynamic code analysis

automatically detect bugs or security vulnerabilities

assist in code optimization and refactoring

verify correctness or compliance with best practices

generate test cases and documentations



team formation:

4 at most; average contributions

main tasks:

1.initial research: define a specific problem or a set of problems to address (bug detection, test case generation)

2.proposal: 11.15 -> no more than 4 pages [problem statement, objectives and brief literature]

3.presentation: 15 min, 10th week -> discussion-fix your proposal



experimentation & comparison:

ablation studies; strengths and weakness

results & analysis:

review paper (>=12pages) for IEEE conference format
